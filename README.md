# Blogdev
Blog pour d√©veloppeurs

This is the Project 5 work on Openclassrooms about creating a full blog in PHP . 
The object here is to present a functionnal blog and understand the comprehension of github. 
I chose to add a few more options about the blog, like the interface of a basic network in order to get something quite more beautiful to present.
